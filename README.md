<h4>About</h4>
Itâ€™s been 5 years since I built my blog site with Jekyll in early 2019. Back then, I was a DEC/VAX VMS-11 suppor and system's analyst with Georgia-Pacific thru 2006. In my last day, I could feel the dissapointments from both CTO and teammates about my performance during one and a half years of employment. It was plain to see that I made a wrong career decision. I was very bad at querying database, but pretty good at querying the DOM, so I decided to pivot and began my career as Frontend Developer. Despite my bad performance, I made few good friends at G-P.  I graduated in 1986 with a BS in computer systems.
